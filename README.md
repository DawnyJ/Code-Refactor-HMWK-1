# Code-Refactor-HMWK-1

Description:
The goal of this assignment was to refactor the code provided or make changes to the code without changing the the anything on the site. The approach that I took was simply making changes that would make reviewing and editing the code easier to do than when I started, add accessibility to the site, and understanding comments within the css code easy. The following updates were made:
    1. Added alt text to all of the images that were listed in the index.html and the style.css
    2. Combined the three divs under the "benefits" class for the selector in css file (".benefits div")
    3. Combined h3 headers under the benefits class for the selector in css file (".benefits h3")
    4. Combined the 3 images under the benefits class for the selector in css file (".benefits img")
    5. Combined 3 divs under the content class for the selector in css file* (".content div")
    6. Combined 3 images within the content class for the selector in css file (".content img")
    7. Combined h2 headings within the content class for the selector in css file (".content h2")
